# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

This is my attempt at cloud resume challenge in AWS.
What is Cloud Resume Challenge? - [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) is a multiple-step resume project which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career in Cloud. The project was published by Forrest Brazeal.

## Architecture

- Deploy your resume as a S3 static website, use HTTPS and Amazon CloudFront.
- Point a custom DNS domain name to your CloudFront Distribution.
- Add a visitor Counter to your website using Javascript.
- Setup a DynamoDB database to log the visitor counter.
- Create an API to communicate your javascript code with DynamoDB.
- Create a Lambda function using Python, triggered by your API Gateway, that reads from the DynamoDB table and updates the visitor counter. Create tests for your Python code as well.
- Write it all as Infrastructure as Code using SAM.
- Setup two GitHub repositories, back-end and front-end, for your code and use GitHub actions to automate updates and deployment.
